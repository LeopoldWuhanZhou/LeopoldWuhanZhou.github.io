I am a second year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://eecs.pku.edu.cn), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn). My major is Electronic Information Science and Technology and I am pursuing a double major in mathematics at [School of Mathematics](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn).

My current research interests are algebraic combinatorics. And I want to do something in mathematical physics, algebraic geometry and number theory in the future.

I enjoy travelling, hiking, music and occult.
You can find some travel literature in the [Blog Posts](https://pkublink.github.io/year-archive/) part.

My Chinese name is 周无寒. The name Leopold comes from [Leopold Fitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Fitz), who is one of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s top scientific minds.
